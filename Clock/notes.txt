Transform :
 transform: rotate(20deg);
Transform-origin: to change rotating point , without this it will rotate from center point
Transition :

The following example adds a transition effect for both the width and height property, with a duration of 2 seconds for the width and 4 seconds for the height:

div {
  transition: width 2s, height 4s;
}
Transition : all 2s => for all property
Transition timing function:

The transition-timing-function property specifies the speed curve of the transition effect.
The transition-timing-function property can have the following values:
ease - specifies a transition effect with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)
linear - specifies a transition effect with the same speed from start to end
ease-in - specifies a transition effect with a slow start
ease-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow end
ease-in-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow start and end
cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function
 

Note: If the duration part is not specified, the transition will have no effect, because the default value is 0.
